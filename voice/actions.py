A conversational assistant needs to have collected important details needed to answer user questions in the right context. Otherwise, no happy path. Simple enough, and known as slot filling. But how do you gather and define the details that matter before taking action, or providing a response? Slot filling is made easy with our new addition of FormPolicy. This is a fresh feature that implements slot filling in an easy and effective way. How? FormPolicy allows you to cover all the happy paths with a single story. Forms also let you alter logic within a happy path, without needing to change the training data. So, how do you implement this new technique? Glad you asked. Hereâ€™s how to get FormPolicy working for you."
